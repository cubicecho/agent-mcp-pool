/**
 * Writes `llms.txt` from what `src/index.ts` actually exports.
 *
 * Generated rather than written because the hand-maintained alternative is a second copy of the
 * API surface that drifts from the first, which is the failure this repo has already had to fix
 * once. Anything wrong here should be fixed in the doc comment it came from.
 *
 * The parse is deliberately small and hand-rolled. TypeScript 7 is the native compiler and no
 * longer ships the JS API this would otherwise have used; its replacement is published under
 * `typescript/unstable/*`, and `build` is what `prepare` runs, so an unstable API breaking under
 * a caret range would break publishing. The shape being read is our own and regular, so reading
 * it directly costs less than that risk — and every assumption below throws rather than guessing,
 * so a source file that stops matching fails the build instead of quietly emitting less.
